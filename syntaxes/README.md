# Syntax files

The following files are generated by a script. Do not modify them directly.

## LaTeX.tmLanguage.json

Embedding languages into the LaTeX grammar requires to duplicate a lot of code with minor changes. To ease maintenance, all the language embeddings (basically `minted` and `XXXcode` blocks) are generated by the script `../build/generate-grammar-blocks.js` based on `data/LaTeX.tmLanguage.json`.

Currently, the following environments for source code listings are supported:
- `lstlisting` from [listings](https://ctan.org/pkg/listings),
- `minted` from [minted](https://ctan.org/pkg/minted),
- `pyglist` from [verbments](https://ctan.org/pkg/verbments),
- `pygmented` from [pygmentex](https://ctan.org/pkg/pygmentex) and [texments](https://ctan.org/pkg/texments).

## cpp-grammar-bailout.tmLanguage.json

This is a modified C/C++ grammar file enhanced to make sure that the end of the LaTeX environment is properly detected. It is generated by the script `../build/generate-bailout.js` based on based on https://github.com/jeff-hykin/better-cpp-syntax.

## markdown-latex-combined.tmLanguage.json

This file is a combined markdown/LaTeX grammar file based on https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/main/extensions/markdown-basics/syntaxes/markdown.tmLanguage.json.
It is generated by the script `../build/latex-md.js`.
